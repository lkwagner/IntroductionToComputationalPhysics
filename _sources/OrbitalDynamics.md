## Overview

+++

In this assignment we will learn how to simulate the orbital dynamics of a planet going around the sun (which we assume to be fixed).  We will then proceed to use simulation to test two of the most important physics results in the last 400 years.  

First, we will numerically validate Kepler's Second Law: a planet sweeps out the same area of its orbit in equal time.  Kepler's first law (all planets ü™ê orbit in ellipses) and Kepler's third law (the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit) will be left as extra credit.  

Then we will see that general relativity alters the Newtonian law of gravitation in such a way that the planets no longer move in ellipses.  Instead, their closest approach to the sun (the perihelion) changes its location slightly as you go around the Sun.  Mesuring this effect in Mercury was one of the key original validations of general relativity.

## Exercise 1. Orbital Dynamics

+++

+++

### a. Modify your code to include the force of gravity

+++

In Newton‚Äôs model the earth‚Äôs gravity is a central force that exerts an attractive pull

$$\vec{F}(\vec{r}) = m\vec{a}(\vec{r}) = -\frac{Gm_\textrm{earth}m}{r^2}\hat{r}$$
between the earth and another mass m. In the formula G is Newton‚Äôs constant, $6.674 \times 10^{-11} m^3/\textrm{kg}/\textrm{sec}^2$. The mass of the earth is approximately $5.972 \times 10^{24}$ kg.  Because the gravitational force from the earth is proportional to an object‚Äôs mass, its gravitationally induced acceleration is independent of its mass.

Let‚Äôs place the origin of a right handed coordinate system at the earth‚Äôs center, with the equator lying in the x,y plane and the x axis passing through $0^{\circ}$ longitude. To simplify things let‚Äôs assume that the orbit of any object of interest lies in the $x,y$ plane. As you can see in the following figure, the angle œÜ is taken with respect to the x axis. We are fixing $\theta = 90^{\circ}$.

+++

<div><img src="https://clark.physics.illinois.edu/246img/coord.png" width=400 alt="coordinate frame"></img><br></div>

+++

We can write the $x, y$ components of the gravitational acceleration as

$$a_x = -\frac{Gm_\textrm{earth} }{x^2+y^2}\cos \phi = - \frac{Gm_\textrm{earth} x }{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}$$


$$a_y = -\frac{Gm_\textrm{earth} }{x^2+y^2}\sin \phi = - \frac{Gm_\textrm{earth} y }{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}$$


ü¶âModify your code to correctly incorporate gravity.

+++

Copy over your previous work for an integrator.  Assuming the sun is at (0,0) modify your Modify your force function to implement the gravitational force.  Use the parameters in your force function. Also modify your `Orbit` function to run for a time `params["T"]` instead of when it hits the ground. In my code, I also put in a `param['CrashRadius']` that terminated my code in addition to `param["T"]`.  Btw, if you use the "tab" button it will tell you what's in your SolarSystemParameters dictionary.  There will be nothing to run here just the functions (you will make plots below)

### b.  Earth Orbiting the Sun

+++

Write some code to set up the parameters of the Earth orbiting the sun and then plot it.  Use a dt of 3600 seconds.  This will involve calling your functions from above. You will want to build a dictionary of `params`  which involve things like your initial positions (use Earth's orbital radius), your initial velocity, the time step `dt` (use one day), etc.  You should be able to plot it as `plt.plot(positions[:,0],positions[:,1])`
`
<!--
To draw the Earth, I recommend something like:
```python
earth_radius = SolarSystemParameters["EarthRadius"] # m
# create a (blank) figure so we can set some of its attributes. 
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.gca()
# set labels and title; force square aspect ratio. 
ax.set_xlabel("orbit x, km")
ax.set_ylabel("orbit y, km")
ax.set_title("GPS satellite trial orbit") 
ax.set_aspect("equal")
# plot stuff, 
#plt.plot(xarray, yarray)
# force the axes to be of equal scales... 
rmax = np.max( (xarray**2+yarray**2)**0.5)
pltmax = 1.05 * rmax
plt.axis([-pltmax, pltmax, -pltmax, pltmax])
# now draw the earth
earth_disk = plt.Circle((0, 0), earth_radius , color = "#99FF99")
fig.gca().add_artist(earth_disk)
```

### d. Geosyncronous Orbit (Extra Credit: 5 Points)

+++

ü¶âDetermine the height a spaceship needs to be above the surface of the Earth to be in circular Geosynchronous orbit. A geosynchronous orbit is one that stays over the same point of Earth for the entire orbit.   To determine this, we need to set up our orbit simulation to run for an Earth/Satellite simulation.


A useful thing to know is that the velocity that you need to apply tangeant to a circular orbit to stay in a circular orbit of radius $r$ is 
$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}} $$

Then compute the orbit of that trajectory.  To show that it's geosynchronous you want it to produce an orbit that is a circle in one day.  You can make your `m` small (say 100 kg).  I recommend a `dt` of 1 second.

## Exercise 2. Kepler's Laws

+++

* **List of collaborators:**

* **References you used in developing your code:**

+++

Kepler developed three laws about planetary motion (using data from Tycho Brahe on planetary motion).  In this exercise you will explicitly check Kepler's laws.

The three laws are (from ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion)):

(1) The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.

(2) A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.

(3) The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.

+++

### a. Law 2

+++

Kepler's second law tells us that the planet sweeps out the same "area" of the ellipse in a fixed amount of time.  
ü¶âVerify this by computing (and plotting) the area swept out in these two regions:

* $0.2 T_\textrm{orbit}<t<0.2T_\textrm{orbit}+0.1T_\textrm{orbit}$
* $0.6 T_\textrm{orbit}<t<0.6 T_\textrm{orbit}+0.1T_\textrm{orbit}$

where $T_\textrm{orbit}$ is the total time for an orbit.  Use Earth's orbit to do this and a time-step of 1 hour.  

To compute the area, I summed a bunch of triangles that make up the points on the orbit.  Toward that end I found it useful to write a `TriangleArea` function. 

Here's what my random orbit looks like (don't worry about adding colors):

+++

### b. Law 1 (Extra Credit: 10 points)

+++

The first law tells us that the orbit is an ellipse and the sun is at a foci.  ü¶âTo check this, 
* Modify the constants in your code to emulate planets (i.e. let `M` be the mass of the sun, $M_\textrm{sun} = 1.989 \times 10^{30}$ kg) 
* Let `dt` be an hour
* Emulate some eccentric orbits.  To do this, change the initial velocity by a little bit.  This will give you some eccentric orbits.
* Check that the orbit you get is an ellipse with the sun is a foci.

The latter is a little subtle.  To check that you have an ellipse, we should verify that the points (`orbit.xs`) satisfy the general equation for an ellipse.  

The general equation for an ellipse ([stackexchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/426150/what-is-the-general-equation-of-the-ellipse-that-is-not-in-the-origin-and-rotate)) is 

$$ \frac{((x-h)\cos(A) + (y-k)\sin(A))^2}{a^2} + \frac{((x-h)\sin(A) - (y-k)\cos(A))^2}{b^2} =1$$

where $a$ is the length of the semi-major axis, $b$ is the length of the semi-minor axis, $(h,k)$ is the center of the ellipse and $A$ is the angle of the ellipse.

Given a foci, we can compute the points closest and further from the loci, $p_{min}$ and $p_{max}$ which are at distance $r_{min}$ and $r_{max}$.

With these we can compute  
* $a=\frac{r_\textrm{min}+r_\textrm{max}}{2}$   
* $b=\sqrt{r_\textrm{min}r_\textrm{max}}$  
* the center $(h,k) = (p_\textrm{max}+p_\textrm{min})/2$.  
* the semi-major axis $\vec{a}=(p_\textrm{max}-p_\textrm{min})$
* the angle $A=\tan^{-1}[\vec{a}(1)/\vec{a}(0)]$

I wrote a function `CheckEllipse` that given a set of coordinates (and the foci of the sun at the origin) assumed it was an ellipse and checked if the points obeyed this equation.

### c. Law 3: (Extra Credit: 10 points)

+++

Kepler's third law tells us that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.

In other words, $T^2 \propto a^3$.

+++

*From Wikipedia quoting Kepler on finding the third law:*
![image.png](attachment:image.png)

+++

ü¶âVerify Kepler's third law by computing the orbital period $T$ (write a function that finds when your orbit essentially gets back to its starting place) and the semi-major axis (as you did above) for 25 different orbits.  To generate these orbits use random initial starting velocities of the form 

```python
v_circ = np.sqrt(G*M/r0)
v0=[v_circ+np.random.uniform(-0.2,0.2)*v_circ,np.random.uniform(-0.2,0.2)*v_circ]
```

Then graph $T^2$ vs. $a^3$ and show that this makes a line.  ü¶âShow that the slope of this line is 
$$\frac{GM}{4\pi^2}$$

+++

It is helpful to add code to your class that stops your simulation after you return to the starting point. This can be done by either:
* checking that the distance from the starting point gets further away->closer->further away
* monitoring the $r$ of your planet 
* by checking how close the $x$ location is to your initial spot  


It'll save you valuable running time if you implement this, but it is not necessary.

## Background (just information...no work on this problem)

+++

**Post-Newtonian gravitational orbits**

+++

Trajectories in $1/r^2$ central force fields are conic sections: hyperbolas or parabolas for unbound objects, and ellipses for objects in bound orbits. A special property of an inverse-square force is that bound orbits close on themselves‚Äîthe orientation in space of the ellipse remains fixed. But if gravity were to deviate from a purely inverse-square force law, bound orbits would not close (unless they were perfectly circular), and could not strictly be described as ellipses.

One of the earliest tests of general relativity was its prediction for the rate at which Mercury‚Äôs orbit would change its orientation over time. Mercury‚Äôs distance from (the center of) the sun varies from 46,001,200 km at perihelion (the point at which Mercury is closest to the sun) to 69,816,900 km at aphelion, so it samples the strength of the sun‚Äôs gravitational pull over a significant range of distance.

The orbit‚Äôs long axis precesses 574.1 seconds of arc per century. [<sup>1</sup>](#fn1). (There are 3,600 seconds of arc in one degree.) Most of this is due to the perturbing effects of the other planets, but there is a measurable contribution of 43 seconds of arc per century from the small differences between the (approximately correct) Newtonian and (extraordinarily accurate) Einsteinian descriptions of gravity. The force law, according to general relativity, isn‚Äôt quite an inverse square relation. [<sup>2</sup>](#fn2)

The precession rate is small. During the course of one orbit of 87.969 days, the perihelion will shift by $(5.022 \pm 0.005) \times 10^{-7}$ radians due to general relativistic effects. This corresponds to a displacement in space of about 23 km for one orbit‚Äôs perihelion relative to the previous orbit‚Äôs, added to the much larger Newtonian perturbations from the other planets.

In weak gravitational fields we can accommodate the effects of general relativity as a slight modification [<sup>3</sup>](#fn3) to the acceleration of a mass $m$ in an almost-elliptical orbit around the sun:


$$ \frac{F(r)}{m} = \frac{GM_\odot}{r^2} + \frac{3r_s\left(v_\textrm{perihelion}r_\textrm{perihelion}\right)^2}{2r^4}$$

where $M_\odot=1.98855 \times 10^{30}$ kg is the mass of the sun.[<sup>4</sup>](#fn4).  You may recall that the Schwarzschild radius $r_s$ of an object of mass $M$ is $2GM/c^2$, and that the sun's $r_s$ is 2,953.36 meters.  For Mercury $v_\textrm{perihelion}=58,980$ m/s while $r_\textrm{perihelion} = 46,001,200$ km.  (Note that the formula requires the perihelion radius to be expressed in meters.)[<sup>5</sup>](#fn5)

Just for your information, here is a table of contributions to the Newtonian precession of Mercury‚Äôs perihelion from the other planets. The largest come from Venus (because it is so close to Mercury) and Jupiter (because it is so massive). These are taken from the work of the 19th century astronomer Urban LeVerrier.[<sup>6</sup>](#fn6).  I think they‚Äôre probably reasonable approximations to the exact values.

## Exercise 3: Mercury Precision

+++

* **List of collaborators:**

* **References you used in developing your code:**

+++

Our goal in this exercise is to determine how general relativity affects the precision of Mercury.  We know from Kepler's laws that objects orbiting around a central body orbit in an ellipse.  That means the second time around their orbit they come back to the same place that they started.  If you have more then two bodies (like above) or if there are corrections to gravity from general relativity (which there are), then you aren't going to come back exactly to the same place.  Instead the orbit precesses around.  There's a good picture [here](https://aether.lbl.gov/www/classes/p10/gr/PrecessionperihelionMercury.htm).   

In this assignment, it will be important to work with all your arrays being ***long doubles***.   You should be able to accomplish this mainly by setting the initial conditions of your array to long double. 

To measure the precision you want measure the angle between two consecutive perihelions (the closest distance on ellipse of the orbit). The most sensible thing is to start at the perihelion and then measure its closest distance when it comes around again.  This is not too hard to do but a bit tricky to get correct.  Here is a good prescription:
* Start at the perihelion. 
* Perform slightly more then one orbit (say 10% more)
* Measure the index in the array for the closest distance you get when you come back around.  To avoid measuring the fact that you are close at your "starting" location, I recommend that you look for your closest distance that isn't in the first quarter of the orbit.
*  Now, because you are taking discrete time steps, the closest location you find might not actually be the closest location (because maybe it got closer somewhere between the steps you took).  This will matter for this measurement.  To fix this, let's interpolate between around this part of the orbit.  
    * Take the three points before and after the position you found in the orbit
    * Fit a quadratic curve around this part of the orbit: `line=np.polyfit(x,y,2)`
    * Find the closest location of this curve by producing a new array with 100000 points which goes from the three points before and after the position you found `np.linspace`
    * Get the angle between the lines (sun,original perihelion) and (sun, new perihelion)
    
It will probably help you if you write a function perihelion that takes the positions array and generates the angle of precision.

+++

### a.  Mercury without general relativity

+++

For our first step, we will compute the precession when we don't have the relativistic term on.  If our integration was perfect, we should get zero. As we recall from earlier assignments, we know that that there is some time-step errors associated with our integration.  So instead of getting zero, we would expect to get something very close to zero.

+++

You are going to base your Mercury perihelion code on your orbital code from previous units. Let's start by setting up your code for simulating Mercury's orbit: 

* $r_\textrm{min}=4.60012 \times 10^{10}$ m
* $v=5.898 \times 10^{4}$ m/s
* $T=60 \times 60 \times 24 \times 88 *1.1$ sec  (1.1 Mercury Years)
* $dt=60$  sec.

ü¶âPlot the orbit of the eccentric Mercury and  report the closest (both with and without interpolation) and furthest distance your simulation gets from the sun as well as your precision.  

When you run, use `%time orbit.Run()` to measure how long it takes. 

I get that the run takes approximately 7 seconds and get
```
The minimum location before interpolation is  46001200000.51781079
The minimum location after interpolation is  46001199999.997996964
The maximum location is  2.2018129525667883981e+21
The precision angle I get is  -0.028552737845785832 radians
```

We will consider -0.03 microradians essentially zero. 

*It is often very useful to make a plot of your zoomed in orbit and the interpolated line. If you aren't getting the right answer, you should do this!*

+++

**HINT:** For this assignment you need to get 5 points around the closest distance (the second time around the orbit *not* where you start.  You should get 
```
x                    y                    r 
-10087525.09595282 46001199082.443085 46001200188.48122315

7606474.822704569 46001199478.327866 46001200107.20775908
```

If you're not getting this, then you should check again.  Then you need to interpolate through this data (`    line=np.polyfit(x,y,2)`).  Finally, you should get that the nearest distance is (after interpolation) something very close to `46001199999.997996964`.

### b.  Mercury with general relativity

+++

Now turn on the effects of general relativity (by modifying your force) and do the same computation. 

The post-Newtonian modification to the gravitational acceleration experienced by Mercury adds an extra term after the inverse-square Newtonian term:
$$ \frac{F(r)}{m} = \frac{GM_\odot}{r^2} + \frac{3r_s\left(v_\textrm{perihelion}r_\textrm{perihelion}\right)^2}{2r^4}$$

The Schwarzschild radius of the sun is $r_S = 2,953.36$ meters. Mercury‚Äôs speed at perihelion is
$v_\textrm{perihelion} = 58,980$ m/s while its $r_\textrm{perihelion} = 4.60012e10$ m. Recall that you should start with $dt=0.1$ and $M_{sun} = 1.98855e30$

ü¶âPlease add the post-Newtonian term to the acceleration of gravity, 

I now get (in 11 seconds)
```
The minimum location before interpolation is  46001200000.654238053
The minimum location after interpolation is  46001199999.99801791
The maximum location is  46923484445.272278626
The precision angle I get is  0.4887683792163817
```

Note that the actual value is 0.5022 microradians per orbit. That‚Äôs pretty good!

+++

**HINT:** For this assignment you need to get 5 points around the closest distance (the second time around the orbit *not* where you start.  You should get

If you're not getting this, then you should check again.  Then you need to interpolate through this data (`    line=np.polyfit(x,y,2)`).  Finally, you should get that the nearest distance is (after interpolation) something very close to `46001199999.99801791`.

+++

If you are trying to get spacecraft around the solar system, an important thing to be able to do is to get a spacecraft from one point to another point in a time $T$.  To do this, the spacecraft will need to choose a particular velocity (speed and direction) to be heading in. Write a function ```Transfer(pos1,pos2,T)``` which determines the velocity to get the spacecraft from pos1 to pos2 in time T.

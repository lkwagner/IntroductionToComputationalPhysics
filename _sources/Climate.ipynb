    "You should get a pretty crazy result in this case. Essentially every latitude is doing its own thing; they are independent because the diffusion transports heat between the latitudes and we have ignored it so far.  Therefore, you're going to see some pretty sharp jumps in the temperature as you change latitudes.  In addition, there is a large (~117&deg; C) difference in temperature between the poles and the equator.\n"

    "We are missing an important piece of the physics once we've moved to 1D.  The temperature at different latitudes can interact with each other.  Heat can move both by diffusion and advection.  Here we are going to concern ourself primarily with diffusion.  We've seen diffusion before in this class but typically as $\\partial^2/ \\partial x^2$.  In our case though we are on a sphere and need to do something different essentially writing our gradient in spherical coordinates - see the last term of our energy balance model.    \n",

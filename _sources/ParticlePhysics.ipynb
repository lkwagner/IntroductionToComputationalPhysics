    "In 1979 a particle physics experiment led by Jim Christenson published a report[<sup>1</sup>](#fn1)  describing a small anomaly in the behavior of K mesons that suggested a breakdown in causality at subnuclear distance scales. The effect—seen at two standard deviations above background—deserved further investigation. Surely it must have been a matter of bad luck, or unforeseen systematic errors. But confirmation of Christenson’s result would show that the laws of nature were, at small distances, non-local (a string theory, perhaps), or else that physical law could no longer be formulated in mathematical language. Our world would be properly described by string theory, or by magic.  \n",

    "Some years after the Christenson result George Gollin proposed a new experiment using a different technique to look for the same effect. We planned to do it at Fermilab, with much better precision and greatly reduced systematic uncertainties, and a few of us set about designing the apparatus for the measurement[<sup>2</sup>](#fn2).   \n",

    "Let’s imagine a stripped-down Fermilab experiment to begin with a target, out of which will stream a monoenergetic \"pencil\" beam of relativistic $K$ mesons. By this I mean that all kaons travel in exactly the same direction with the same energy, and move precisely along the z axis. Some distance downstream of the target will be a pair of tracking chambers and a hadron calorimeter—a device that measures the energies of charged pions—but nothing else. We’ll put a hole down the center of the calorimeter to prevent the beam from damaging the device. Since a high energy neutral $K$ beam can be expected to contain more neutrons than kaons, this is an important feature of our calorimeter, which would otherwise be fried by the beam. In our model we’ll assume that kaons have total energy 60 GeV, typical of kaons in Gollin's experiment. We’ll concentrate on the charged ($\\pi^+\\pi^-$) decay mode.   \n",

You were, in effect, measuring the \"geometrical acceptance\" of the circle when exposed to a random \"beam\" of points. There were only two numbers you needed to describe uniquely each \"event\" (the placing of a point inside the square): the point's x and y coordinates. And the boundary in that x, y parameter space is easy to imagine: it's just a circle of unit diameter.  \n",

In our case we can completely characterize an event by specifying the z position of the decaying kaon and the two (spherical coordinate) angles needed to describe the direction of the positive pion. Everything else—the pion energies in the lab frame, for example, or the momentum of the other pion, or where in the plane of the calorimeter the pions land—can be derived from these. In a more realistic model we would need to specify the kaon’s energy and vector momentum (since it is not possible to create a monochromatic kaon beam), the x, y, z coordinates of its decay point, the pion directions in the kaon rest frame, and so on.   \n",

It should be obvious that we can move the kaon-producing target upstream to good effect. That will make the “solid angle” subtended by the hole smaller, and fewer pions will find it.

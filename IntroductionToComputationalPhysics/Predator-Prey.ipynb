It's not the case that once you have a certain population of predator/prey it returns to this number over and over again forever.  This occurs because we are simulating the ecosystem deterministically - there is no randomness involved.  Deterministic equations essentially can only do a few things: they can converge to fixed points, limit cycles or be chaotic. \n",

This is unrealistic, since there aren't actually frational animals (and also it prevents extinction events).

Essentially every latitude is doing its own thing; they are independent because the diffusion transports heat between the latitudes and we have ignored it so far.  Therefore, you're going to see some pretty sharp jumps in the temperature as you change latitudes.  In addition, there is a large (~117&deg; C) difference in temperature between the poles and the equator.\n"

Here we are going to concern ourself primarily with diffusion.  We've seen diffusion before in this class but typically as $\\partial^2/ \\partial x^2$.

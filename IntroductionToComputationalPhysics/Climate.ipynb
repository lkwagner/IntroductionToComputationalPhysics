    "We are missing an important piece of the physics once we've moved to 1D.  The temperature at different latitudes can interact with each other.  Temperature can move both by diffusion and advection.  Here we are going to concern ourself primarily with diffusion.  We've seen diffusion before in this class but typically as $\\partial^2/ \\partial x^2$.  In our case though we are on a sphere and need to do something different essentially writing our gradient in spherical coordinates - see the last term of our energy balance model.    \n",

Unfortunately, this won't work here (we run into numerical instabilities at the poles). What we need to do is use an implicit solver of our differential equations.
